This directory contains the source code of PyNEST, the Python bindings
to the NEST kernel. A detailed explanation of PyNEST can be found in

PyNEST will be compiled together with NEST by default. If you want to
disable it, pass

    --without-python

as an argument to `./configure`. By default, `make install` will install
PyNEST to `$(pyexecdir)`, which is often expanded as follows:

    $(prefix)/lib{,64}/pythonX.Y/site-packages/nest

To make the PyNEST module available to the Python interpreter, add the
PyNEST installation path (without the final '/nest') to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable.

For help on a NEST object OBJ in PyNEST, type nest.help(OBJ). To find
out more about NEST, type nest.helpdesk().
